# FusionPBX REST API
This README is lacking. For now. This is an app for [FusionPBX](http://www.fusionpbx.com/).

# Install
To install it, clone into fusionpbx's `app/` folder and run the menu upgrades (Log into the web
  interface, Advanced -> Upgrade, check Schema and Menu Defaults, press Execute).
