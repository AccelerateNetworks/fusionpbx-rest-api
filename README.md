# FusionPBX REST API
This README is lacking. For now. This is an app for [FusionPBX](http://www.fusionpbx.com/).

# Install
To install it, clone into fusionpbx's `app/` folder and run the menu upgrades (Advanced->Upgrade,
  check off Menu Defaults and hit Execute). Note that FusionPBX seems to prefer lower case naming
  with underscores, so when cloning be sure to clone to or rename the folder `rest_api`.
